# Tiny-Aura

My intention is to learn how to use individual AuraPHP packages and what better way than to build my own custom framework out of them. I have no delusions of grandure. Tiny Aura will always be tiny and humble. Though I might use it for a real project if it works out well :-)

I may end up using some other packages such as the Symfony console component or Laravel's illuminate/container but my intention is to do as much as I can with only AuraPHP packages.

For now I don't want to focus on trying to build packages so the Tiny Aura core will all be contained in the Core directory. If I ever get far with this and learn enough about AuraPHP I'll consider making it a package like laravel/framework is.

## Todo
- [ ] Build up the basic application structure
- [ ] Decide on a base set of packages required for basic web app functionality
- [ ] Create some unit tests for the basic core
- [ ] Create the basic core

More Todo's to come but that should keep me busy and learning for a while

## List of basic core things
- [ ] Single secure entry point
- [ ] Basic routing
- [ ] Models, Views, Controllers
- [ ] Basic DB access layer via PDO (MySql only for now)
